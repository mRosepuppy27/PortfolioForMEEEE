Links to the final form of the projects are below: 

-IllusionBuildings: This is a Pinna-Brelstaff rotating circle illusion inspired creation. I wanted to create that illusion, while having it act as building windows to make it more interesting. It's like optical portals or geometry that disrupts how the buildings behind them are viewed. preview.openprocessing.org/sketch/2817997/preview/false/index.html?&random=0.20867813092816656

-GeologicSkyClock: This piece represents 24 hours in a day, via horizontal layers in the color of the sky that would likely be present during that hour. Minutes are shown by slowly drawing another lighter colored layer over the current hour's layer. Seconds are represented as "fossils" which can be seen generating in the current hour's layer every second. https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2823201/embed/

-Squares: These squares are supposed to recreate the artwork: Sans Titre (Untitled) 1984, by Vera Molnar, (url to his artwork = https://spalterdigital.com/artworks/sans-titre-untitled-3/).  https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2747772/embed/

-LandscapeStructure: This 3D landscape is just a creation of a randomly generative 3D landscape with trees in the left corner. It uses Perlin Noise and WEBGL coding. https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2757218/embed/

-BirdHunt: This is a really simple mini game with no real objective. You have a bird that follows your cursor (in the shape of a target) indefinitetly until your cursor is inside the "safe zone" (the green circle). The "safe zone" regenerates in random spots every time you refresh the page and every time the bird touches your cursor. https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2770639/embed/
